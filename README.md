## Hi, I'm Quinn 👋

I'm a data analyst who loves finding the story hiding inside a messy dataset. Whether it's building a dashboard, writing a complex query, or cleaning up a spreadsheet that's seen better days, I'm in my element when I'm working with data.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills

SQL · Python (Pandas) · BigQuery · Tableau · Looker · Excel

## ☕️ Beyond Data

When I'm not wrangling data, you'll find me on a long bike ride or hunting down a great cup of coffee.
Feel free to explore my projects or reach out — always happy to connect!
